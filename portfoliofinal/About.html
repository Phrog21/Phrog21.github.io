        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>I have had a passion for computer software from a very young age. Because of this deep-rooted love, I am
            currently pursuing a <i>Bachelor's degree in Computer Science</i> through the <i>College of Western Idaho.</i>
            This program has given me the tools and resources necessary to jumpstart <b>a long and fulfilling career in the
                technology industry.</b></p>
    
        <p><i>CWI</i> has granted me an affordable way to take my dream of working as a developer and make it a reality.
            Everyday I am grateful for the opportunities I am granted by my institution. I make sure to participate in
            extracurriculars such as <I>The CWI Gaming Club</I> and <i>Cyber Security Conferences.</i> </p>
